Hi there! We're team Jack and not Jill! 

We'd love to go over our thought during this hackathon with you :)


The Challenge
==============
1) Free up staff resources by automatically answering common questions
2) Reduce friction along the path to making a purchase
3) Increase customer engagement, brand loyalty


Our Research
=============
To understand the scope of our problem better, we decided to give CandyBoxx a call and ask the representative there a couple of questions! So we asked them if they knew of the hackathon that was happening (she did) and how she thought that the chatbox would help their business. She confirmed that the main issue that the call center was having was to answer questions about shipping and sizes -- information that is readily accessible on the site. They also spend a lot of time suggesting items to their clients (who are mostly female). Women often have a clearer sense of what they want to get, but when it comes to men, they need a little more guidance to find the right item. She also mentioned if there was a way for the chatbot to present information on current discounts, then that would be a great additional feature.

Key point
==========
Essentially, she wanted a chatbot that would mimic the behaviour of a real life customer service representative instore.


Solution for #1
================
We free up staff resources since we answer the most common question asked (shipping and sizing)

Solution for #2
================
We designed our chatbot to minimize friction by reducing the number of actions they need to take to purchase an item. By letting the customer click on buttons to discover products that they want, they're able to see products within 2-4 clicks(touches) as opposed to dozens of keystrokes

Solution for #3
================
We incorporated the contact us to make sure that they know that Candyboxx is always ready to help them.
We added discounts for further incentivization (as wanted by Candyboxx)
Button taps makes it easy to interact therefore increases engagement.

THANKS!!!

Challenges we Faced
==================
- We were a team of 2 and one of us had troubles connecting to the facebook api.
- Also we thought that NLP was difficult to get right so we opted for a much more simplistic (and dumb) approach that hopefully still offers a compelling user experience.
- We also had issues with urls and images :/

Notes and thoughts
